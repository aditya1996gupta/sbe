<template>
  <div class="page">
  <h1>Foo!</h1>
    <p>Okay, now use your browser\'s back button to navigate back to the home page.</p>
    <p>If you had scrolled down previously, you will notice that when you go
      backwards the scroll position was saved at the top of the page rather
      than where you clicked the link.</p>
      <h2>How should it work?</h2>
      <p>Remove the transition wrapping &lt;router-view&gt;&lt;/router-view&gt; and try it again.</p>
      <p>You will see that the scroll position is saved exactly where you followed the link</p>
    </div>
